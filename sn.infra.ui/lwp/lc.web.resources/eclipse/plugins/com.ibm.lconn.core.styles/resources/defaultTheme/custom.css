The contents of this file will be included with the Cascading Style Sheets 
(CSS) for each Lotus Connections application for the default theme.

The CSS rules in this file will be located after all of the core styles, but
before the CSS that is part of the theme. If you need to make more extensive 
changes or remove CSS rules, individually override the other files in this 
directory.
   
This file should output CSS rules and does not need <style> tags.

Example contents:

   .lotusui #lotusLogo {display: none;}
